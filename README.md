## About Land Rover

Land Rover is a British multinational automotive company specializing in four-wheel-drive vehicles. Founded in 1948, Land Rover has evolved from a single model offered by the Rover Company to become a globally recognized brand known for its premium off-road vehicles and luxury SUVs.

## Generations

- **Series I, II, and III (1948-1985)**: The original Land Rover was introduced as a robust, agricultural 4×4 vehicle with a simple design and exceptional off-road capability. The Series I (1948-1958) established Land Rover's reputation for ruggedness, followed by the refined Series II (1958-1971) and Series III (1971-1985) models with gradually improved comfort and capability while maintaining the iconic boxy design.

- **Defender Era (1983-2016, 2020-present)**: Originally called the Land Rover 90, 110, and 127 based on wheelbase length, this model was renamed "Defender" in 1990. The classic Defender maintained the utilitarian design philosophy of the Series models for over three decades until production ended in 2016. After a brief hiatus, Land Rover reintroduced the Defender in 2020 as a thoroughly modern vehicle that maintains the spirit and capability of the original while incorporating contemporary technology and comfort.

- **Range Rover (1970-present)**: Introduced as the first luxury SUV, the Range Rover created an entirely new market segment. Through four generations, it has maintained its position as a premium vehicle offering uncompromised off-road capability combined with on-road comfort and luxury features. The Range Rover has expanded into a sub-brand including the Range Rover Sport, Range Rover Evoque, and Range Rover Velar.

- **Discovery Series (1989-present)**: Positioned between the utilitarian Defender and luxury Range Rover, the Discovery offers family-friendly versatility with genuine off-road capability. Through five generations, it has evolved from a practical alternative to the Range Rover into a distinctive luxury SUV with advanced terrain management systems.

- **Freelander/Discovery Sport Era (1997-present)**: Land Rover entered the compact SUV market with the Freelander, which became one of Europe's best-selling 4×4s. The second-generation model continued this success until it was replaced by the Discovery Sport in 2014, which maintains the compact dimensions while offering increased capability and premium features.
